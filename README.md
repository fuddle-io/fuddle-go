A Go SDK for the [Fuddle](https://github.com/fuddle-io/fuddle) service registry,
which applications use to subscribe to registry updates and register local
members.

# Usage

## Installation
```
go get github.com/fuddle-io/fuddle-go
```

## Usage
See the [package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fuddle-io/fuddle-go)
for SDK usage, and [Fuddle](https://github.com/fuddle-io/fuddle) for
documentation on the Fuddle registry.

## Testing
